**Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project**

Based on the project assignment requirements, run_analysis.R does the following:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In order to prepare run_analysis.R to run the following steps have to be completed:
1.	Download the data source and extract it into the working directory. 
2.	Put run_analysis.R in the working directory (setwd() function can be used if required).

**Dependencies**

Reshape2 package must be installed prior to running run_analysis.R.
